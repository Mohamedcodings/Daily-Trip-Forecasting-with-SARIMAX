### File Structure
- **prog.py**: Contains the SARIMAX model implementation for forecasting daily trips.
- **prog2.py**: Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) of various data files to gain insights into the data.

### Dataset Information
- **calendar_dates.txt**: Contains special dates (e.g., holidays) and their attributes.
- **trips.txt**: Contains information about different trips, linked to dates via service_id.
- **stop_times.txt**: Details about the stop times for each trip.
- **routes.txt**: Information about the different transit routes.
- **stops.txt**: Data about the transit stops.
- **transfers.txt**: Details about transfers between stops.
- **pathways.txt**: Information on pathways connecting stops.

### Code Explanation
- **prog.py**
  - **Load and Clean Data**: Load `calendar_dates` and `trips` data, then merge to associate trips with dates.
  - **Prepare Data**: Set the date as index, group by date, and split into training and testing datasets.
  - **Modeling**: Fit a SARIMAX model to the training data and predict/forecast future trips.
  - **Plotting**: Visualize training data, test data, predictions, and forecasted values.

- **prog2.py**
  - **Load Data**: Load several datasets to understand the data structure.
  - **EDA**: Inspect the data via `.head()` and `.info()` methods, and check the unique counts of key columns.
  - **Statistics and Visualization**: Calculate statistics like stops per trip and visualize their distribution.

### Images
- **forecast1.png**: Generated by `prog.py`. This graph shows the daily trips forecast with training data, test data, predictions, and forecast.
- **forecast2.png**: Generated by `prog2.py`. This histogram visualizes the distribution of stops per trip.

### Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone <repo_url>`
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Python packages like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `statsmodels` are installed.
3. **Run the Code**:
   - For the SARIMAX forecast, execute `prog.py`.
   - For exploratory data analysis, execute `prog2.py`.
4. **View Outputs**: The forecast and EDA outputs will be saved as images (`forecast1.png` and `forecast2.png`).
